# TSF-Net: Tempo-Spatial-Fusion Network for Deepfake Detection

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of **TSF-Net**, a hybrid deepfake detection framework that dynamically integrates spatial and temporal analysis. TSF-Net introduces several novel components for enhanced manipulation detection including Cross-Modal Attention Fusion (CMAF), Temporal Inconsistency Attention Module (TIAM), Artifact-Aware Loss Function (AALF), and Adaptive Computational Scaling (ACS).
